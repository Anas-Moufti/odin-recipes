        <h2>The Best pizza</h2>
        <p>This classic pizza is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
                <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
                <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
                <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).</p>
                    <p>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.)</li>
                <li>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry pizza noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)</li>
            </ol>
